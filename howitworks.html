      <h1>How it Works</h1>
      
      <h2>Get Console Solution</h2>
      
      <p>
      Get Console Private Server is a virtual appliance - run it on VMWare in the corporate datacenter or private cloud. Additing Get Console Private Server transforms the Get Console app and iPad into an enterprise field team support and management tool. Get Console app users in the field can instantly access corporate standard configuration templates, check on service requests and get remote assistance by sharing their iPad terminal screen with remote NOC engineers.</p>

      <div class="work-left">
        <h2>3 minute video summary of Get Console</h2>
        <p>The basic Get Console terminal application has been enhanced with specific command shortcuts, cut/paste integration, detailed logging and a file/script browser. In addition the Get Console session sharing allows the local terminal session to be tunneled inside HTTPS to a get-console backend server. The method to encapsulate serial data within HTTPS is proprietary but is designed to both optimize the transmission and also survive firewall inspection (ie, it uses standards compliant HTTP messages).</p><br />

        <p>One of the (currently 3) Get-Console backend servers (or the customers own Private Server), take the tunneled serial session, generate a one-time session code for it and advises that code back to the Get Console app. The field engineer can then either txt, email or simply verbally advise the NOC engineer of the session code . The get-console backend server also performs a multiplexing function to merge and sync an incoming SSH session from the webfront end with the tunneled serial session, thus making a 2 way end-to-end "serial" connection.</p>

      <p>The get-console.com web front end server provides a javascript based terminal window for accessing the field engineers console session via the session code. 
In addition, the web front end captures the remote access log file, and also provides config and file upload/download capabilities.</p>

      <h2>What hardware is required?</h2>
      
      <p>
      The Get Console app runs on Apple iPhone (3G , 3GS, 4), iPad (1,2), and iPod Touch (2Gen, 3Gen, 4Gen). All Apple devices must be running version iOS 4.2 or later. In addition to the app, for serial connections the user must have the "Redpark" RJ-45 Serial adaptor (Model C2-RJ45). This adaptor is a 1.8meter apple 30pin to RJ-45 (Cisco console) cable.</p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>       
       
      <h2>What Costs are involved?</h2>
      
      <p>
      <ul style="list-style:decimal">
      
        <li>The Get Console app is US$9.99 available from the Apple app store</li>
        <li>The Redpark Apple 30 Pin to Cisco Console cable is US$59.00 available from www.get-console.com/shop or other retailers including www.redpark.com. Discounts for bulk purchases are available.</li>
        <li>For customers wanting to host their own Private Server version of the Get Console backend software inhouse then an additional client access license priced from $12 per device (depending on volume and whether they are yearly or perpetual). There is no charge for the Private Server software itself.</li>
      </ul>

The remote access feature via the Get Console public website is currently free for Get Console app purchasers that register on this site.
In addition the iPhone or iPad should have a 3G dataplan with the wireless carrier.</p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>       
       
      <h2>How does it compare to Webex / Team Viewer etc</h2>
      
      <p>
      The Get Console solution is designed primarily for the narrow niche of network equipment field services. Other solutions require the field engineer to have a laptop (with a working 3G or Wifi connection to the Internet). In addition, sending strange characters - such as "break" and "ctrl-shift-6" etc via a webex / teamviewer session is difficult, and ultimately their solution will cost more as it was not designed for network field service operations.</p>
